# COG Load Demo

The repo and site are built as a demonstration of how to load a SINGLE BAND COG using Openlayers 6.  Openlayers is really the best source to see how to do this.  The main goal is to provide a JS example on how to develop a colour gradeint using the raw tif values from the COG. A basic query pop-up is added so users can see the pixel value at that location.

- The site is an aerial imagery base map, with a Sea Surface Temperature (SST) raster over top.  

- This repo is not likley to be well maintained.  It will only get periodic updates only to help keep it working.

- Anyone is welcome to clone this repo and make it their own.

- Data used on this site is from JPL and LINZ Data Service
